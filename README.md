# genomics-data-analysis

genomic_main/main.py is the script for generating the answers to next questions:
- **Q1**: How many people there is in the experiment? Display the numbers of healthy people and infected ones.
- **Q2**: What is the number of mutations per chromosome? What is the total number of mutations?
- **Q3**: Generate histograms: Minor Allele Frequency, Percantage of REF Allele Homozygot, Percentage of ALT Allele Homozygot, Percentage of Heterozygot (per mutation)
- **Q4**: Run chi-square test, do you need to apply multiple testing correction? If yes, apply it. Preview this on Manhattan Diagram. See the results with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
- **Q5**: Using UCSC Genome browser and Omim website find the information about diseases connected to one or more genes shown significant in the experiment.

All generated files are in *generated_files* folder.
