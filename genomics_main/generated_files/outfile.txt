Question 4:
4a -> Running chi-square...
Done.
4b -> The correction is neccesary, because we have over one milion mutations, and that effects the limit for p-value.
I'm using Bonferroni correction so as the limit I'm using 0.05/len(data) in code I used len(chi2) but it is the same length.
Bonferroni correction is just changing the limit, but there are also other corrections in use.
4c -> Plots saved in a file 4c_manhattan.png
4d -> Running HWE...
Done

Question 5:
[('chromosome: 1', 'position: 16896217')]
UCSC Genome Browser: Chromosome 1, position 16896217 constains gene called NBPF1. (GRCh37/hg19)
NBPF stands for neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1. 
NBPF1 is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with NBPF1 include Astrocytoma and Neuroblastoma. (GeneCard)
